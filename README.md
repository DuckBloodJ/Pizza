## Introduction 
Project Description
In response to recent EU regulations that have banned centralized take-away ordering services for pizza restaurants, each restaurant in Europe is now required to operate its own independent pizza ordering system. This project aims to develop a comprehensive software solution for a pizza restaurant, enabling it to manage its own ordering, processing, and delivery operations effectively.

Given the expertise of pizza restaurants in software architecture design, they have decided to adopt a well-structured, modular approach by separating the concerns of models, controllers, and views within the system. This separation aligns with best practices in software engineering, ensuring that the system is scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend in the future.

While some of you may have already worked on a controller for a similar system during your Software Engineering course, this project will focus on building and integrating the model layer, as well as expanding the systemâ€™s overall functionality to meet the specific needs of a modern pizza restaurant.
